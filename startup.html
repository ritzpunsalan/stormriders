    a little about me: 
        my hobbies consist of regular exercises per week to do extreme activities during the weekends when I'm not working at my other jobs. But when I'm
        feeling like not running into any extreme activities for the weekends, I end up playing video games, going to events, fixing things up or sleeping in.
